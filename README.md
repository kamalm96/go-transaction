## Features
- Simulates transactions between users.
- Supports concurrent transaction handling.
- Implements database interactions using `sqlc`.
- Includes unit tests to validate functionality.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Golang
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **SQL Query Builder**: `sqlc`
- **Testing Framework**: `testify` (for assertions)

## Current Work in Progress (WIP)
- Developing core transaction functionalities.
- Implementing tests to ensure concurrency and database consistency.
- Adding error handling and edge-case validations.
- Enhancing database schema for scalability.
